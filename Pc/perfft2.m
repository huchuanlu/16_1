% PERFFT2  2D Fourier transform of Moisan's periodic image component
%
% Usage: [P, S, p, s] = perfft2(im)
%
% Argument:  im - Image to be transformed
% Returns:    P - 2D fft of periodic image component
%             S - 2D fft of smooth component
%             p - Periodic component (spatial domain)
%             s - Smooth component (spatial domain)
%
% Moisan's "Periodic plus Smooth Image Decomposition" decomposes an image 
% into two components
%        im = p + s
% where s is the 'smooth' component with mean 0 and p is the 'periodic'
% component which has no sharp discontinuities when one moves cyclically across
% the image boundaries.  
%
% This wonderful decomposition is very useful when one wants to obtain an FFT of
% an image with minimal artifacts introduced from the boundary discontinuities.
% The image p gathers most of the image information but avoids periodization
% artifacts.
%
% The typical use of this function is to obtain a 'periodic only' fft of an
% image 
%   >>  P = perfft2(im);
%
% Displaying the amplitude spectrum of P will yield a clean spectrum without the
% typical vertical-horizontal 'cross' arising from the image boundaries that you
% would normally see.
%
% Note if you are using the function to perform filtering in the frequency
% domain you may want to retain s (the smooth component in the spatial domain)
% and add it back to the filtered result at the end.  
%
% The computational cost of obtaining the 'periodic only' FFT involves taking an
% additional FFT.
