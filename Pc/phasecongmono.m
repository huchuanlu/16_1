% PHASECONGMONO - phase congruency of an image using monogenic filters
%
% This code is considerably faster than PHASECONG3 but you may prefer the
% output from PHASECONG3's oriented filters.
%
% There are potentially many arguments, here is the full usage:
%
%   [PC or ft T] =  ...
%                phasecongmono(im, nscale, minWaveLength, mult, ...
%                         sigmaOnf, k, cutOff, g, deviationGain, noiseMethod)
%
% However, apart from the image, all parameters have defaults and the
% usage can be as simple as:
%
%    phaseCong = phasecongmono(im);
% 
% Arguments:
%              Default values      Description
%
%    nscale           4    - Number of wavelet scales, try values 3-6
%                            A lower value will reveal more fine scale
%                            features. A larger value will highlight 'major'
%                            features.
%    minWaveLength    3    - Wavelength of smallest scale filter.
%    mult             2.1  - Scaling factor between successive filters.
%    sigmaOnf         0.55 - Ratio of the standard deviation of the Gaussian 
%                            describing the log Gabor filter's transfer function 
%                            in the frequency domain to the filter center frequency.
%    k                3.0  - No of standard deviations of the noise energy beyond
%                            the mean at which we set the noise threshold point.
%                            You may want to vary this up to a value of 10 or
%                            20 for noisy images 
%    cutOff           0.5  - The fractional measure of frequency spread
%                            below which phase congruency values get penalized.
%    g                10   - Controls the sharpness of the transition in
%                            the sigmoid function used to weight phase
%                            congruency for frequency spread.                        
%    deviationGain    1.5  - Amplification to apply to the calculated phase
%                            deviation result. Increasing this sharpens the
%                            edge responses, but can also attenuate their
%                            magnitude if the gain is too large.  Sensible
%                            values to use lie in the range 1-2.
%    noiseMethod      -1   - Parameter specifies method used to determine
%                            noise statistics. 
%                              -1 use median of smallest scale filter responses
%                              -2 use mode of smallest scale filter responses
%                               0+ use noiseMethod value as the fixed noise threshold 
%                            A value of 0 will turn off all noise compensation.
%
% Returned values:
%    PC         - Phase congruency indicating edge significance
%    or         - Orientation image in integer degrees 0-180,
%                 positive anticlockwise.
%                 0 corresponds to a vertical edge, 90 is horizontal.
%    ft         - Local weighted mean phase angle at every point in the
%                 image.  A value of pi/2 corresponds to a bright line, 0
%                 corresponds to a step and -pi/2 is a dark line.
%    T          - Calculated noise threshold (can be useful for
%                 diagnosing noise characteristics of images).  Once you know
%                 this you can then specify fixed thresholds and save some
%                 computation time.
%
% Notes on specifying parameters:  
%
% The parameters can be specified as a full list eg.
%  >> PC = phasecongmono(im, 5, 3, 2.5, 0.55, 2.0);
%
% or as a partial list with unspecified parameters taking on default values
%  >> PC = phasecongmono(im, 5, 3);
%
% or as a partial list of parameters followed by some parameters specified via a
% keyword-value pair, remaining parameters are set to defaults, for example:
%  >> PC = phasecongmono(im, 5, 3, 'k', 2.5);
% 
% The convolutions are done via the FFT.  Many of the parameters relate to the
% specification of the filters in the frequency plane.  The values do not seem
% to be very critical and the defaults are usually fine.  You may want to
% experiment with the values of 'nscales' and 'k', the noise compensation
% factor.
%
% Typical sequence of operations to obtain an edge image:
%
%  >> [PC, or] = phasecongmono(imread('lena.tif'));
%  >> nm = nonmaxsup(PC, or, 1.5);   % nonmaxima suppression
%  >> bw = hysthresh(nm, 0.1, 0.3);  % hysteresis thresholding 0.1 - 0.3
%  >> show(bw)
%
% Notes on filter settings to obtain even coverage of the spectrum
% sigmaOnf       .85   mult 1.3
% sigmaOnf       .75   mult 1.6     (filter bandwidth ~1 octave)
% sigmaOnf       .65   mult 2.1  
% sigmaOnf       .55   mult 3       (filter bandwidth ~2 octaves)
%
% Note that better results are achieved using the large bandwidth filters.  
% I generally use a sigmaOnf value of 0.55 or even smaller.

    % Construct the monogenic filters in the frequency domain.  The two

    % Assuming the noise is Gaussian the response of the filters to noise will
    % form Rayleigh distribution.  We use the filter responses at the smallest
    % scale as a guide to the underlying noise level because the smallest scale
    % filters spend most of their time responding to noise, and only
    % occasionally responding to features. Either the median, or the mode, of
    % the distribution of filter responses can be used as a robust statistic to
    % estimate the distribution mean and standard deviation as these are related
    % to the median or mode by fixed constants.  The response of the larger
    % scale filters to noise can then be estimated from the smallest scale
    % filter response according to their relative bandwidths.
    %
    % This code assumes that the expected reponse to noise on the phase
    % congruency calculation is simply the sum of the expected noise responses
    % of each of the filters.  This is a simplistic overestimate, however these
    % two quantities should be related by some constant that will depend on the

    % Compute phase congruency.  The original measure,

    % localised so this was modified to
    % PC = cos(phasedeviation) - |sin(phasedeviation)| 
    % (Note this was actually calculated via dot and cross products.)  This measure
    % approximates 
    % PC = 1 - phasedeviation.  

    % However, rather than use dot and cross products it is simpler and more
    % efficient to simply use acos(energy/sumAn) to obtain the weighted phase
    % deviation directly.  Note, in the expression below the noise threshold is
    % not subtracted from energy immediately as this would interfere with the
    % phase deviation computation.  Instead it is applied as a weighting as a
    % fraction by which energy exceeds the noise threshold.  This weighting is
    % applied in addition to the weighting for frequency spread.  Note also the
    % phase deviation gain factor which acts to sharpen up the edge response. A
    % value of 1.5 seems to work well.  Sensible values are from 1 to about 2.

% RAYLEIGHMODE
%
% Computes mode of a vector/matrix of data that is assumed to come from a
% Rayleigh distribution.
%
% Usage:  rmode = rayleighmode(data, nbins)
%
% Arguments:  data  - data assumed to come from a Rayleigh distribution
%             nbins - Optional number of bins to use when forming histogram
%                     of the data to determine the mode.
%
% Mode is computed by forming a histogram of the data over 50 bins and then
% finding the maximum value in the histogram.  Mean and standard deviation
% can then be calculated from the mode as they are related by fixed
% constants.
%
% mean = mode * sqrt(pi/2)
% std dev = mode * sqrt((4-pi)/2)
